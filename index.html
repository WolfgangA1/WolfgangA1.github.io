                <h2 class="project_headings">Jac Enterprises Island-Hopping</h2>
                <p>As part of a team of four, I contributed to the development of Jac Enterprises' island-hopping webpage using a variety
                of technologies, including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, Express, EJS, Node, and Agile (Scrum) methodology. Our team
                effectively utilized the project board on Github to track progress and ensure everyone was working collaboratively and
                efficiently.</p>

                <h2 class="project_headings">Jac Enterprises Mystery Educator</h2>
                <p>Worked in a group of three people to build out a webpage for kids to learn new things from NASA and the Met museum. We
                used the APIs that NASA and the Met Museum offered. Used Axios to fetch our Get requests to grab the info we wanted to
                present. We also built out an API using Java that had kid books in it to display on our webpage. We utilized the project
                board in GitHub to stay on track and to practice an Agile environment.</p>

                <h2 class="project_headings">My Apothecary's Garden</h2>
                <p>It was developed collaboratively by a team of five people who shared a common goal of creating an informative herb page
                about medical uses.To achieve this, the team built a RESTful API that served as the backend for the web application. The
                API allowed the team to fetch and manipulate data from a database of medicinal herbs, which was used to populate the
                frontend of the application with relevant information. Additionally, the team used GitHub's project board to track
                progress and ensure an Agile development process.</p>
